Project-demo as part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/pro-ruby-on-rails-rails5">Professional Ruby on Rails Developer with Rails 5</a> course. The application remains in development, but the latest version is live at: https://myrecipes-demo.herokuapp.com.

## Project/Course Overview

This course has been focussed on practising and understanding the fundamentals of Rails. Most of the code has been written from scratch and without the use of generators, shortcuts or scaffolding. 

Some key skills I have been developing through this project include:

- A real-time comments feature using ActionCable (note: this feature has not yet been deployed to Heroku)

- Using the Cloud9 IDE for the project;

- Working with Git for version control and GitHub as the repository;

- Understanding and deeply engaging with the Rails MVC;

- Building an authentication system from scratch by using the default Rails stack, including admin feature, log in/logout and signup;

- Working with Bootstrap to build the UI and using gravatars;

- Using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the majority of the application, and building an automated test suite side-by-side with the app featuring model (unit) and feature (integration) tests with the default rails testing framework;

- Database design, migrations, one-to-many and many-to-many associations at the database layer, and implementation using Rails and ActiveRecord.
